        student's request as long as you have notified us before the stipulated time.  </p>

    <h2>FAQ for Tutors</h2>
<li> <h4> 1. Q: Who are we?</h4>

<p>A: We are a dedicated service provider who aims to lead and revolutionize 

the tuition industry. </p></li>

<li><h4>2. Q: Why are we reliable?</h4>

<p>A: We are a legal business entity registered with ACRA.</p></li>

<li><h4>3. Q: How do we charge?</h4>

<p>A: We charge 50% of the tuition fee for the first month only.</p></li>
<li><h4>4. Q: I am new to tuition and I have no experience in teaching, can I 

become a tutor?</h4>

<p>A: Yes. If you want, we can provide you with some rookie’s training before 

the start of your tuition.</p></li>

<li><h4>5. Q: What qualification(s) do I need to become a tutor in Easy Ace 

Tuition?</h4>

<p>A: You have to possess at least the ‘O’ level or equivalent certification for 

academic tuition or relevant certification for other field of teaching. E.g., 

musical certification.</p></li>

<li><h4>6. Q: How do I gain higher priority in student allocation? </h4>

<p>
    <div>- Be mobile;</div>

<div>- Be able to teach subjects which fewer tutors can teach such as 

Economics, English, Biology and Chemistry;</div>

<div>- Contribute to our Teaching Material Reservoir;</div>

<div>- Fill in every Teaching Record;</div>

<div>- Receive positive feedback from students.</div></p></li>

<li><h4>7. Q: Do I need to prepare the teaching materials by myself?</h4>

<p>A: Not necessarily. We will try our best to support you with all the materials 

we have to ease your preparation. In exchange, you are strongly encouraged 

to enrich our common Teaching Material Reservoir with your material and 

you will be ranked higher in the student allocation. </p></li>

<li><h4>8. Q: Is there a trial lesson? Will I be paid for the trial lesson? </h4>

<p>A: Yes, there is one trial lesson for each tuition case. If the student finds the 

first allocated tutor unsuitable after the first lesson, we are willing to change 

the tutor for him. The first lesson conducted will not be charged. 

However, if the student is satisfied with the first tutor and decide to 

continue, the first lesson will be chargeable.</p></li>
<li><h4>9. What is Star Rating System?</h4>

<p>This system is used to evaluate tutors’ teaching ability.
<div><img src = "{%static 'images/tutor_star.png'%}" /></div></p></li>
<li><h4>10. Why do we have Star Rating System?</h4>

<p>This system is designed to reward better tutors. If you earn higher Star 

Rating, you will 

<div>a) gain priority to display your name in the front of the tutor list on our 

website; </div>

<div>b) be able to ask for higher price;</div>

<div>c) have higher chance to teach group tuitions, thus earning higher income.</div></p></li>

<li><h4>11. Q: How likely will you assign me with a new student?</h4>

<p>A: As we only admit the tutors who pass the pre-teaching screening, you will 

be more likely to be assigned a student compared to other agencies once we 

admit you. </p></li>

<li><h4>12. Q: Must I fill in the teaching record each time after the lesson?</h4>

<p>A: Yes. Filling one Teaching Record takes roughly 30 seconds or less. It helps 

you track your teaching experience and more importantly, you can earn 

higher priority in the next student allocation.</p> </li>

<li><h4>13. Q: Will Easy Ace change my student without my permission?</h4>

<p>A: No. We will never change your student without your permission or any 

valid reason.</p></li>
<li><h4>14. Q: Will I earn more profits than working for other tuition centers?</h4>

<p>A: Yes, if you are loyal. As you continue to teach at Easy Ace, your Star 

Rating increases, your price will generally increase. You can even have 

higher chance to teach group tuitions, thus earning higher income. </p></li>

<li><h4>15. Q: How will I receive my payment(s)?</h4>

<p>A: You should collect the tuition fee from the students by yourself. However, 

you must pay us the amount stated on the contract which will be signed 

right after assignment.</p></li>

<li><h4>16. Q: How do I pay Easy Ace?</h4>

<p>A: Please contact the Tutor Manager and She/he will give you the bank 

account.</p></li>
<li><h4>17. Q: Can I reschedule lessons? Is there a penalty for rescheduling?</h4>

<p>A: Yes and yes. You should directly inform the Tutor Manager assigned to 

you and your tutee at least 3 days in advance for cancellation/rescheduling/ 

addition of lesson so that we can arrange to minimise the loss to the student. 

Late informing will adversely affect your star rating and thus your pay. </p></li>

<li><h4>18. Q: What will happen if I have to cancel the tuition within the 1th 

month?  </h4>

<p>A: This is strongly discouraged. During the contract period, if you cancel the 

tuition upon agreement with the student, you will only need to pay half the 

amount of the money you have earned for the tuition sessions. However, if 

you cancel the tuition without the permission of the student, you will have 

to pay the full amount as stated in the tutor’s contract.</p></li>
